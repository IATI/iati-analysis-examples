# IATI Analysis Examples

This repository contains examples of analysis carried out using IATI data and tooling.

Each piece of analysis is self-contained and has its own subfolder, including:
* A README describing the analysis
* The code/pipeline used
* Additional files such as codelists.

If you wish to contribute, please raise an issue. State whether you are suggesting a bug fix or an addition to the analysis.
Next, raise a pull request, quoting the issue. Suggested changes will be reviewed by one of the maintainers of this repository.

Due to capacity, we are not able to support people to set up and run the analyses contained in this repository.
